# Build a drag and drop to-do list

> This repository is the companion to the ["Build a drag and drop to-do list"](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-a-drag-and-drop-to-do-list/) practice exercise.

Build a Kanban-style to do list, where you can drag the cards from one column to the other to mark them as "To do", "In Progress" or "Done".

- app should have three columns: "To do", "In progress", "Done"
- users can drag and drop cards from one column to the other
- users can add tasks by typing into an input above the columns
- users can delete tasks by dragging and dropping over a "trash" area at the bottom of the columns
